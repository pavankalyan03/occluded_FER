# Occluded Facial Expression Recognition

This project presents a novel approach to facial expression recognition (FER) focused on handling occlusions (e.g., masks, sunglasses, hands). We've collected a unique dataset of manually occluded facial images and trained a custom model to accurately classify emotions even when facial features are partially obscured.

## üí° Key Features

- **Custom Occluded Dataset:** A diverse collection of manually occluded facial images, capturing various emotions and occlusion types.
- **Robust Model:** A specifically trained model designed to perform well on occluded faces, achieving improved accuracy compared to traditional FER models.
- **Practical Applications:** Potential use cases in healthcare, security, human-computer interaction, and more.

## üìä Dataset

Our dataset consists of:
- Approximately 5000 images of 120 individuals.
- 7 emotions
- occlusion types:  masks, sunglasses, hands, hair, light, Angles etc.,

## üõ†Ô∏è Model Architecture

We developed a custom model architecture based on CNN.

- **Attention Mechanism:** [Explain how the model focuses on relevant facial regions.]
- **Data Augmentation:**  [Describe any augmentation techniques used to simulate occlusions during training.]
- **Loss Function:**  [Mention any specific loss function adjustments for robustness.]

## üöÄ Getting Started
